## Market Data API Strategy

Based on the research, obtaining free, real-time Indian stock market data APIs for equity, futures, and options is challenging. Most reliable sources are paid services (e.g., NSE, BSE directly, or through brokers like Upstox, Zerodha, ICICIDirect).

For a paper trading application, we have a few options:

1.  **Delayed Data:** Utilize APIs that provide slightly delayed data (e.g., 15-minute delay). This is often available for free or at a very low cost and can still provide a good simulation experience for learning purposes.
2.  **Historical Data:** Rely primarily on historical data for backtesting and end-of-day analysis. This is more readily available and can be used to simulate trades based on past market movements.
3.  **Limited Real-time Data (Trial/Free Tier):** Some APIs might offer a limited free tier with real-time data, but these often come with usage restrictions (e.g., number of requests per day, limited scrips).

**Recommendation:**

Given the 


Given the requirement for a paper trading application and the difficulty in obtaining free real-time data, I recommend the following approach:

*   **Initial Phase:** Start with a combination of **delayed data** (if available and suitable for simulation) and **historical data**. This will allow us to build the core functionality of the paper trading platform without immediate reliance on expensive real-time feeds.
*   **Future Enhancement:** Once the core application is stable, explore integrating with paid APIs like Upstox, Zerodha Kite Connect, or Truedata for real-time data. This can be offered as a premium feature or an upgrade path.

For the initial phase, I will investigate APIs that offer delayed or historical Indian stock market data. I will prioritize ease of integration and cost-effectiveness.
